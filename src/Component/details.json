        "description": "From a fishing village to opulent Kyoto, Memoirs Of A Geisha is the story of a peasant girl, who is sold to a famous geisha house.\n\nSummary Of The Book\n\nA geisha recounts her fascinating journey at New York\u2019s Waldorf Astoria. This journey is presented in an epical manner in Memoirs Of A Geisha by Arthur Golden. At once tempting, ugly, beguiling and enchanting, the novel wears a many-layered cloak. The book showcases the story of celebrated geisha Nitta Sayuri. From a little fishing village, Nitta is sold as an apprentice and servant to a famous geisha house in the 1930s, in Kyoto. The book uses twenty years of intriguing Japanese history as a perfect backdrop.\n\nGion, Kyoto\u2019s geisha district, presents an intriguing collage of glamour, ugliness, beauty and falsity. Memoirs Of A Geisha showcases the opulent decadence of Kyoto, where there are auctions to sell a girl\u2019s virginity and women are trained to entice powerful clients. Young girls are trained in the arts of the geisha such as singing, dancing, wearing kimonos, pouring tea and seducing men with ease.\n\nAppearance is the most important aspect of a geisha. Love and feelings are treated as illusions. The novel presents a detailed picture of Kyoto with its little alleys, teahouses, glittering temples, artistic activities and theaters. Sold at the tender age of nine, Sayuri learns to compete with her rivals for male attention and earn money as well. However, the eruption of World War II forces all geisha houses to shut down. Sayuri embarks on a new quest for reinvention and freedom with little food and money for comfort.\n\nReleased in 1997, Memoirs Of A Geisha has been translated into thirty two languages. The novel opened to rapturous adulation from critics and readers alike. It remained on the bestseller lists of the New York Times for two whole years. The book has sold in excess of four million copies in English worldwide. The book was adapted into a film, which was released in 2005.",

When asked this, I closed my eyes and went back in my own past. And I thought. . . . . . of the days, when life's most complex choices had a simple solution of Akkad Bakkad Bambey Bo! . . . of the seasons when rains were celebrated by making paper boats. . . . of the times when waiting at the railway crossing meant counting the bogies of the train passing by. When I opened my eyes, it seems like it Happened Yesterday! Like it was yesterday that I broke my first tooth and fell in love for the first time.",
